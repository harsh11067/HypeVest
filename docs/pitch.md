## HypeVest — Invest in Creators like Startups

### Problem
Creators generate real revenue but lack transparent, investor-friendly instruments. Fans want upside; investors want data; on-chain rails are fragmented.

### Solution
HypeVest tokenizes creator revenue with Bond/Prediction Markets on Linera. We ingest YouTube analytics via an oracle, route revenue on-chain, and surface investable creator milestones (subscriber goals, revenue tiers).

### Product
- Investor/Creator dashboards (Next.js + MUI, animated UX)
- Trading: prediction markets and bond tranches
- Oracle: YouTube analytics → on-chain updates
- Contracts: Linera SDK 0.15.3 apps for pools and issuance

### Why Now
- Creators are increasingly revenue-first; fans demand aligned incentives.
- L2/alt-L1 infra enables low-fee on-chain cashflows and prediction markets.

### Market
Creator economy >$250B. Addressable first wedge: YouTube creators with predictable ad/sponsor revenue.

### Business Model
Take-rate on volume (trading fees), issuance fees for creators, and premium analytics.

### Traction (Prototype)
- Functional dashboards and trading UI
- Working oracle path to YouTube Data API v3
- Contracts authored for Linera SDK 0.15.3

### Moat
Data-driven underwriting (oracle + off-chain analytics), creator relationships, and novel prediction instruments around milestones.

### Roadmap
1. Mainnet-compatible contracts and audits
2. Creator whitelist and early investor program
3. Expand to multi-platform analytics (Twitch, TikTok, Insta)
4. Secondary liquidity and structured products

### Team
Full-stack + smart contracts + data infra experience; shipping quickly across FE/BE/chain.

### Ask
Design/engineering partners, early creators, and pre-seed capital to accelerate audits and launch.
